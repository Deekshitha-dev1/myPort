# My Portfolio

A modern portfolio website built with React.

## Quick start (clone and run)

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Deekshitha-dev1/myPort.git
   cd myPort
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Build for production

1. Create an optimized production build:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Preview the production build locally (using `serve`):

   ```bash
   npx serve -s build
   ```

## Requirements

- Node.js 14+ and npm (recommend Node 16 or 18)

## Windows notes

- If PowerShell prompts about execution policies or path, run commands from a normal Command Prompt or set Node/npm PATH properly.
- Line endings: Git may warn about LF/CRLF; this is normal on Windows and does not affect the app.

## Customize

- Update your name and bio in `src/components/Hero.jsx` and `src/components/About.jsx`.
- Replace the project list in `src/components/Projects.jsx`.
- Update contact details in `src/components/Contact.jsx`.

## Want this deployed?

I can add a GitHub Pages workflow or a GitHub Actions deploy step to host the site automatically — tell me which provider you prefer.
